Below is a list of literature---both digital and paper-based---that will do two things:  

1. Help you to more fully appreciate the content of this site.
2. Have at least a mildly positive impact on your life.

## [Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143126563/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0143126563&linkCode=as2&tag=youfoolau-20&linkId=VQOBZGSUBJIF3E43)
by David Allen
:   There are few books that I have read that I can honestly say changed the way I think and act on a daily basis. This is one of them. From the day I began reading the book, I became enthused about actually keeping thorough track of *everything* that I want to do, and about striving to have an utterly empty mind. I am *far* from being adept at using the system---after all, I still struggle getting myself to do an actual weekly review---but I know enough about the system to know that once I get my ass in full gear using it, the returns will be realized.

## The Dhammapada
?
:   You'll note the lack of an ascribed author next the name of this book. That's not a mistake. *The Dahammapada* is one small book of the *many* books of the Buddhist canon---otherwise known as the Tripitaka. It is considered by many to be the best single source to capture the essence of Buddhism---regardless of the particular flavor of Buddhism that one may prefer.

:   The book is listed here because it is---in my estimation---a powerful tome that transcends the particular spiritual community that has adopted it. I don't recommend this book as a prescription of faith; there is actually little to no faith involved in Buddhism anyway. I list the book here because it is rife with very good general advice and contains very little gobbledy-gook, if you will.

## The Tao Te Ching
by Lao Tzu[^1]
:   Eastern philosophy is rife with really great books that can (and have) become part of a lot of people's "must read" lists. The *Tao Te Ching* makes mine because it has so much to say (and also *not* to say) about pretty much everything.

## [Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804137382/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0804137382&linkCode=as2&tag=youfoolau-20&linkId=N5BCBIV7R35FTKDG)
By Greg McKeown
:   I first read this book as I began to give up the ghost on becoming an academic, and it helped me come to grips with my new career path. I credit it with helping to slow my roll, and focus on sifting through all the noise to find the signal. I am sure that it will do the same for anyone else who chooses to read it.


[^1]: *Ostensibly* by Lao Tzu. You see, the authorship of the book, actually originally named the *Laozi* for its purported author, is hotly disputed. Laozi (Lao Tzu) was either a real guy---and an extraordinary one at that---who wrote a cool book at the behest of some guard as was leaving town for good to retire, or an entirely fictitious entity created after various maxims were collected into a widely distributable format.
