Nearly every day, I find myself overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information to which I, as a humble non-tech-sector layperson, have access. The internet, for all the faults that it may bring out or reveal in us humans,  never ceases to  impresses me with its ability to provide large amounts of fertilizer for knowledge.

But, as is the case with *abilities*, the internet's ability to fertilize the fields of our minds can go to waste if we don't go about cultivating it in the right way. What follows is a short guide to doing just that. It is a model that I have begun to use for *doing* something with all the information that I come across out there in cyberspace.

###Bite

Attach your attention to the information. This can be anything from saving an article to your "read/review" stack, or just getting it in a psychic space that marks it as something you're going to *really* look at.

###Chew

Take and process the information that you have "bitten" off. This process should take you longer than you think it should. Remember when you've heard---from time to time, and from various outlets---that chewing your food for longer is better for you (on *numerous* levels)? Well the same holds true for processing the information. Really swirl it around your mind for a while, just as you'd let a really good piece of food move around your mouth to hit all the sensory parts of your tongue, so should you let all of the parts of your mind touch the information you're now processing. You'll be glad you did.

###Swallow

This is the part that should take the least amount of time, but *only* if you have a  mature and effective organizational system. Think about it this way. When you're swallowing food, you're starting the process of having your body *use* the food you've just processed---you're now making that food useful. When processing information---learning---it should be no different. You're now passing along that information to that part of your mind that will store it as *knowledge* for you to use. Swallowing the information you're learning involves two main things:

* Verifying that you really do know it. The best way to do this is by testing yourself, which I've found is most effectively done by having to teach or present it to someone else that doesn't know about it at all. I taught philosophy at the community college level for over 4 years, and I learned more about philosophy (that I thought I already knew) in the first 2 years, than I estimate I learned in my entire time in graduate school.

* Organize the information - This part involves making the information readily accessible, and ready for updates, emendations, further analysis, and other reviews. It is also a way to ensure that this chunk of new knowledge finds its way into the web of your current knowledge as a *connected piece*. If you can't connect what you're now learning to what you already know, the chances of you really grabbing a hold of it go down drastically.
