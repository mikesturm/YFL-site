Falling is a recurring theme in my life. The first memory that I have is falling down the basement staircase of the two story bungalow in which I grew up. I was about four years old. It was a cold winter day, and I was all bundled up in my second-hand (third-hand, perhaps) snowsuit. I took one step down, and it was all downhill (or rather, down*stairs*) from there. I tumbled down the stairs.

I busted my lip and bruised my arms and legs. It was the scariest experience of my young life up to that point, and would remain so for a few years. It would not be the last time I fell, though, or the most I'd be hurt by a fall. In fact, the worst fall I would experience wouldn't be a literal one, but rather a figurative one. It hurt like hell nonetheless. The injuries wouldn't be physical, but they would still be very real. And what is worse, I'd have to ascend the very same proverbial staircase I had just fallen down in order to just eke out a normal life.

## A Metaphorical Fall

In late 2006, I had developed a bad habit. I was into prescription drugs. I had graduated from college the year before, and entered graduate school with the goal of obtaining my PhD within 5 years. I was driven, I was determined, I was frantic, I wasâ€¦.burning out---quickly. I was in a hopelessly unhealthy relationship, I had become a near-hermit, and I had no balance in my life. I spent days at a time in a haze of studying, theorizing and worrying. I spent nights arguing and/or sleeping in chairs next to hospital beds, as my girlfriend at the time became sicker and sicker, and our relationship became more toxic. Some of her sickness was legitimate, some of it self-inflicted and exaggerated, but all of the toxicity around me was so very, very real. I never allowed myself to find the middle-ground, the balance. I burned through the stuff you get to when you run out of the midnight oil, until everything was bone dry.

Through it all, I always carried around a stash of pills to get me through. I had white ones, blue ones, green ones, pink ones, circular ones, octagonal ones, uppers, downers, and so on. I woke up to coffee and hydrocodone, lunch brought a mix of ephedrine and tramadol. To sleep it was clonazepam and some sort of alcoholic chaser. For a while, that was balance to me.

After lugging around the addiction(s) to various degrees of severity, I was ordered by law into inpatient treatment in May of 2008. By that time, I had stopped attending classes with any regularity and was barely doing the day-to-day tasks in order to stay in school and keep my job. My grades fell dramatically and I was dismissed from the graduate school via a very professional-looking letter delivered to me in rehab in July. My parents brought it to me on their first visit. So that was nice.

## Inpatient Zero

I spent three months in rehab, meeting, and ultimately befriending people from all walks of life. I met convicts doing time in federal prisons, dealers, thieves, hookers, fathers, mothers, members and higher-ups of nearly every gang in and around Chicago---and some people you would never expect to see there; people like me. Actually, they were *all* just like me; they were addicts. They had come to the end of their respective ropes and were thrown in with everyone else like them to try to pick up the pieces for the next 90 days.

When I first got into the facility, I was unsure of how I would go about living there and what would happen afterward. But within the first day, I heard a counselor---a recovering crack addict with 30 years of addiction and 10 years of recovery under his belt---give a speech about being open-minded, about giving this thing (rehab) a chance in order to give *ourselves* a chance. For whatever reason, I decided that day to stop being a jaded, cynical know-it-all, and drop the intellectual hubris that I had so artfully cultivated in the preceding 24 years. I decided that I needed help, and that treatment was the place to get it.

## A Reminder

The 90 days went by more quickly than I thought they would. I left treatment as the summer was winding down, in August of 2008. My 6 year relationship was ending in much the way I had always secretly wished it would. My parents had come to pick me (a now 25-year-old man-child) up. I was entering a halfway house to make my transition back into sober living. While at the halfway house, I met some great people---people who had been all but given up on by the rest of society, and were trying to find the strength to make a life for themselves. I found that even when things were going badly for them, many of them would still be there to help anyone who was dealing with addiction and its accompanying demons. Every day, as we gathered to pray (in the non-sectarian, personal way that one does in recovery) in the morning, I gained inspiration and wisdom. Sometimes I wondered how I'd gotten to a place where I felt real, genuine peace. I realized that through it all, though there were tough times, I stayed positive about what I was trying to do. I smiled, I breathed, and I simply kept moving forward.

So it was fitting that one day, while working at the job I had managed to get while at the halfway house, I found a rubber band that fit nicely around my wrist. Many people in the recovery community wore rubber bands, to remind themselves to keep going, to snap against their skin when they got a craving, and remind themselves that they could easily be back in jail, or dead if they faltered. I figured that since I often learn visually, I'd write something on the rubber band to remind myself of what I had to do to make it. I took a sharpie from under the counter and wrote "PMA" all around it in fat, black letters. PMA stands for Positive Mental Attitude. It's a concept that's been around for a while. I learned of it through my affinity for hardcore punk, and the band Bad Brains, which had used the phrase many times in their songs. I figured that of all the things that people had told me about my progress and my good qualities, they referred to my being positive and genuine. So if I had to attribute my new way of life to anything, it would be to staying positive, no matter what.

Staying positive doesn't mean wearing rose-colored glasses. It doesn't mean ignoring pain, suffering, setbacks, anger, sadness, and guilt. Rather, it means taking each of those things on its own terms. If there's pain, let it hurt. If there's sadness, let the tears flow. If there are setbacks, acknowledge what has taken place, and why it has set you back. But always see those negative experiences as positive contributors to a positive life.

## I Qualify

The PMA bracelets were lost or broken as time went on, but I wore one every day for years after I left the recovery community and stopped attending meetings. I have given only two of them to other people; one to the woman who is now my wife, and the other for Hakeem, a man I met in the halfway house who taught me the value of hard work and optimism.

Hakeem used to introduce himself in every Narcotics Anonymous meeting he attended by saying "My name is Hakeem, and I qualify to be here", or if he spoke multiple times "My name is Hakeem and I still qualify." It was simple, it was unassuming, but it was profound. He had a humble dignity about him, one that I immediately recognize every time I encounter it, and which I've often tried to emulate---but almost always fail to. He was one of those people where it was easy to see that so much suffering had been housed in his soul, but it had been let go of, and quiet peace now occupied the space where it once lived. I have seen precious few of those people in my life---all of them during my time in the recovery community. They still represent a sort of ideal in my mind of how to conduct oneself.

Wherever you are, Hakeem, I hope that you're still sober and I know that you do indeed still qualify. I may have stopped wearing the bracelet, but I never forgot what it stood for. Now more than ever, I have made it a point to stay positive---to do and say things that reflect an attitude of openness, willingness, and honesty, and to give all that I can to whatever I choose to do. So when I wake up, stretch, and step out the door to run or lift, I do it until I finish, running through any shit that my body wants to give me. When I write, I dig deep and get everything out on the page, and I make sure that the impact I want to make is made.

I haven't been to a meeting in several years. I now enjoy beer and whiskey in moderation---actual, regular-person moderation. Those in AA and NA will tell you that this is impossible for an addict, and I would tend to agree with them. It may be that I never was an addict, but rather just a kid who waited until 25 to grow up, and who just had to fall down life's staircase for a while before that.

There will always be hardships on the path I have chosen, but the only way I can be defeated is if *I* give up. Knowing this, I can rest each day, knowing that I have put my all into what I am doing, and that I don't live in the future, I live now. After all, I can only do what I can do in this moment, that is all I have right now. I'm pretty sure that I can handle that, because in the grand scheme of things, it's pretty small.

If you've read this far, thank you for doing so, and stay positive.
