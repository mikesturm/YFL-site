Eight years ago, in May of 2008, I found myself in a jail cell, playing Scrabble with an 18 year-old kid named Argyle. He was completely certain---despite my initial insistence---that *dopey* wasn't a word. And if the jail's copy of the Scrabble dictionary was anything to go by, he was right. Something told me that this was not the time or place to invoke my nearly perfect writing score on the GRE, so I conceded. I let him have that one, and eventually, the game. I chose instead to retreat to the dark common bunk that I shared with 8 other guys, to lay down and reflect on what the hell had happened to my life. How did I go from a promising tenure as a grad student, on track to get PhD and achieve my dreams to sleeping on a paper-thin county jail mattress? Surely, I had made an error.

## The Thing About Errors...

The thing about errors is that the concept of an error only means anything if things didn't go how you intended them to. But in life, so much of the meaning is constructed on the fly, and in retrospect. It's a toss-up whether this moment is part of the method or the madness...or both. So if I was sitting in a jail cell at twenty-four, but that's the only way to end up where I am at thirty-two, was that an error? I could only know that in retrospect. That's where I am now---here, writing about the time when I thought my life was over as I unsuccessfully tried to fall asleep in a jail cell.

There's never a good time to develop an opioid habit, but my timing was *especially* bad. I was twenty-two, and just beginning graduate school, which as anyone will tell you, is a stressful and taxing undertaking. I was in a very unhealthy and turbulent relationship, with a person who also had addictive tendencies. I was ripe for a fall, and boy did I ever take one. Within a few years, my habit caught up with me. I was arrested and charged. I found myself in the county jail one May morning, awaiting an open bed in the nearby rehab facility. I found myself kicked out of graduate school, with the requirement that I petition my way back in---letters of recommendation and all---and endure 2 semesters of academic probation, to receive my M.A.

This isn't private information. Anyone who knows how to look up public records can find out about it. I could spend countless hours and some serious cash to try to get my record sealed, and mask (though only partially) that blemish on my life---but I won't. Rather than seek to cover over my error---to hide it from myself and others---I have chosen to follow the very Oblique Strategy that first captured my interest:

>Honor thy error as a hidden intention.

The thing about errors is that they are only *really* errors if you don't like or appreciate where you've ended up as a result of them. I happen to *love* where I've ended up. I have a beautiful, kind, intelligent wife who challenges me every day to become a better version of myself. I have a beautiful, intelligent (sensing a them here?), precocious daughter who reminds me to appreciate all the little things every day. I have a day-job that has allowed my hippy-dippy liberal arts background to connect meaningfully to the business world, and pays me decently. I have a wonderful home in a great neighborhood that I look forward to coming home to every day. So from where I stand, what at one time was an error has transformed into a necessary ingredient in a meaningful life.


## ...is That Maybe They're Not *Really* Errors...

This is not to say that I meant to go to jail, spend 90 days in rehab, and have a criminal record attached to my name. But I *did* intentionally do the things that led to all of that. There was no gun to my head; I chose to do what I did. But rather than merely doing my time and waiting to get "back on track", I chose to embrace what I had done as an expression of something deeper within myself. Clearly, some part of me felt like acting out, taking terrible risks, and giving the middle finger to the Illinois criminal code. But if I hadn't honored that part of myself---if I hadn't taken the time to understand *why* I did it, to **own** it, I shudder to think where or (more importantly) *how* I would have ended up.

The thing about errors is that they only remain errors in the short term. On the longer timeline of life, if they are embraced and used to make oneself better, they become part of a success story.---a more *interesting* success story. The error becomes merely an excursion onto an alternate path, where though the destination may be the same as other more ordinary ones, the  scenery is so much more memorable.

So what is an error, anyway? What is an error in creative work? Are there really any errors when you're trying to create something---be it a work of art or a life? After all, creating---as opposed to making---is about original work. Originality leaves behind the trodden paths, the tried and true. It forges new ways; plans be damned.


## ...but Plans in Disguise

So when you're creating, you are not painting by numbers, as it were.  There is no such thing as a plan, in the strict sense of that term. You are free to stray from any plan under which you began working. And if creative work is *expressive*, in that it reveals you and your emotions, could an error actually just be the truest form of unfiltered self-expression?

I guess what I'm trying to say here is that when you make an error consider honoring it. Could it be a truer expression than what you originally planned to do? Don't laugh at the question. I'm willing to bet that you're not done growing yet, which means that you don't know who you're becoming yet. You can't afford to discount the crazy things you've done---to not honor them as some part of you.

Honoring your errors is about welcoming opportunity. It's about being open to explore more than just your narrow plans and concepts of yourself. All of your actions---whether missteps or not---deserve to be honored with at least an acknowledgment and exploration. After all, you did them. Make the best of each one. Your life literally depends on it.

Godspeed.
