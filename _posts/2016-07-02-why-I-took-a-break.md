## Your Life is Not Just Yours

For the past 6 months, I had been blogging very regularly---until about 3 weeks ago. I stopped. But I didn't just stop blogging, I stopped *thinking* about blogging. I stopped making a big deal about it to myself. I began thinking and devoting energy to prioritzing, organizing, and then *doing* the things that are important in my life.

But the funny thing about your life is that it's not just *your* life.

This was proven to me very recently, in fact. My wife's close childhood friend, who was the maid of honor at our wedding 6 years ago, passed away very suddenly last weekend. She was 31. She wasn't sick, she wasn't engaging in risky behavior. She was on a pontoon boat parked in the river, and a fishing boat literally hit her, and killed her.

Everything in our hearts and heads says: *these things are so rare, they just don't happen*. Out of nowhere, a fishing boat just hits you, and that is it. But those things *do* happen. You live life the right way, you say and do the right things, but none of that can avoid a crazy happenstance. You can die even if you do everything right. 

Back to my point about your life not just being *your* life. This woman who died so unexpectedly left behind 3 young kids, a husband, numerous family members, and close friends. They are all grieving---and it's heartbreaking. Her life ended, but so did all of those people's lives *with* her. Her life was not just hers, it was all of theirs. There is so much interconnection, so much buttressing of others' feelings, hopes, and dreams upon your life, and that simple fact is so often and so easily forgotten.

All this is to say that for the past week, I have found myself focusing on that inescapable fact: my life is not just mine. My actions, my words, my attitudes affect everyone around me. More importantly, my lack of actions, my lack of attention, and my lack of vision affects those around me as well.

## Re-focus

So my focus has been on something that I have always suspected to be fundamental to living my life in the best way I can: *GTD*.

*GTD* stands for *Getting Things Done*, which is a book by David Allen published 15 years ago. I will not bore you here with a summary, because I actually think the summary is less than half of the story about why this book is really so good. The book is nominally about "productivity" (whatever people take that to mean) and organization. It does a great job of walking you through how to capture and organize the thoughts you have about what you want to do, and help you think about whether you want do do them, and what you want to do *about* them.

That first part is important. I have a lot of things pop into my mind. Many of them take the form of *it'd be cool to do this thing*. Most of them take the form of *Oh! I've got to do this thing, and this other thing, and I told Bill that I'd have this other thing done by next week, so what do I do about it?*. Then I get stressed, and if I catch myself, I can feel my shoulders tense up, and my palms getting sweaty.

I have lived so much of my life in some degree of that stress, that anxiety, that feeling of not being in control. The *real* benefit of *GTD* is that---if done right---it is essentially a cure for that feeling. Seriously, it is. Yes, it is a "personal productivity system". Yes, it is a method for being more well organized. But because it is those things, it is also a way to live a happier life, to more fully exist in the moment, and here's the kicker: it is way to---at any given moment---feel okay about what you are *not* doing. Read that sentence again. Go ahead, I'll wait.

I submit that nearly all of my stress has come to me because I felt that I should be doing something else---something other than what I was doing at the moment.
