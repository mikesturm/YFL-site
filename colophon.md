##Who I am

I am Mike Sturm. I am a [recovering academic]({{ site.basurl}}why-i-chose-to-give-up-on-academia), now writing about learning, productivity, creativity, and getting better.  At one time, [I taught philosophy](http://mikesturm.weebly.com/philosophyteaching.html), and was hell-bent on making that my career. Now I work in the industrial supply industry, at a pretty cool company in the Midwest.

##What This Is

The name of this site is sardonic, and intended to convey that I do not propose to be an expert at anything, nor do I claim to have a better perspective on any issue than anyone else writing on the same topics as myself. That does not mean, however, that I will not write with sincerity and passion--after all, I *believe* the things that I am saying. At best, I am close to being right on a few things, at worst, I am fumbling through reality much like a punctured dirigible.

##How It's Made

This site is made using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
The site's format is adopted from the code for John Gruber's [website](http://daringfireball.net), which was done for two reasons:

1. The site has exactly the aesthetic and standards-compliance that I value.
2. I know very little about web development.

The posts are written using a [derivative of markdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/), and written in plain text, using one of the following tools:

- [nvAlt](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/)
- [ResophNotes](http://www.resoph.com/ResophNotes/Welcome.html)
- [Simplenote](http://simplenote.com/)
- [editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)[^1]


##Selected Writings

I write about a lot of things, but let's face it, most of it is self-serving. Below is a list of representative pieces, based mostly on objective data, like pageviews.

* [Outline Your Life, or Run the Risk of Failing to Live it](https://medium.com/the-hodgepodge-institute/outline-your-life-or-run-the-risk-of-failing-to-live-it-5d0704e5a355#.vhnosogp5)
