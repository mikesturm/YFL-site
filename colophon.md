##What This Is

The name of this site is sardonic, and intended to convey that I do not propose to be an expert at anything, nor do I claim to have a better perspective on any issue than anyone else writing on the same topics as myself. That does not mean, however, that I will not write with sincerity and passion--after all, I *believe* the things that I am saying. At best, I am close to being right on a few things, at worst, I am fumbling through reality much like a punctured dirigible.

##The Image

The favicon/sidebar icon on my site is excerpted from *Sta≈Ñczyk*, a painting by Jan Matejko. To me it portrays the plight of the modern fool (*read*: me). For an interesting explanation of this painting, and why it should be interesting to someone like you, dear reader, see [this piece](http://theoddmentemporium.tumblr.com/post/26715123339/image-sta%C5%84czyk-by-jan-matejko-the-jester-is), courtesy of [The Oddment Emporium](http://theoddmentemporium.tumblr.com/), which is worth checking out for its own sake.
