Minimal++ theme by Nick Groenen
===============================

A responsive theme for websites, originally by [orderedlist](https://github.com/orderedlist). [Demo the theme](http://zoni.github.com/minimal-plus-plus/) right here on GitHub pages.

Changes from minimal
--------------------

Minimal++ uses [scss](http://sass-lang.com/) to make it a little easier to apply your own brand of awesomesauce to the theme, fixes a few quirks with minimal that were bugging the author, and includes an alternative dark theme in addition to the original dark on light theme.
